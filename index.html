    <h2>ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM</h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="conf-name">Symposium on Chinese Archaeology and Cultural Research</span> is a conference that focuses on
      the archaeology of the Yangzi River, one of the longest rivers in China
      and Asia. The conference is expected to bring together experts in the
      field of archaeology to share their research findings, discuss new
      discoveries, and exchange ideas on the cultural heritage and history of
      the Yangzi River.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference is hosted by Wuhan University, one of the top universities
      in China, and is scheduled to take place in 2023. The Yangzi River has a
      rich history that spans over several thousand years, and the
      archaeological discoveries in the area provide valuable insights into the
      development of ancient Chinese civilization, including the prehistoric
      cultures, Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the Han and Tang dynasties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference aims to explore the different aspects of Yangzi River
      archaeology, including the material culture, religious practices, trade
      and commerce, and the role of the river in the social and political
      organization of ancient Chinese societies. The symposium also hopes to
      foster international collaborations and encourage the participation of
      scholars from around the world to promote academic exchange and knowledge
      sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, <span class="conf-name">Symposium on Chinese Archaeology and Cultural Research</span> will serve as a platform
      for researchers and scholars to discuss the latest archaeological findings
      and explore the significance of the Yangzi River in the development of
      ancient Chinese civilization.
